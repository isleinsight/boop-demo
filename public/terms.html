    <p><em>(For Attorney Review – Draft Only)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Payulot, a digital payment platform operated in Bermuda. By creating an account, accessing, or using the Payulot system, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). Please read carefully, as they establish your rights and obligations when using Payulot.</p>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Bermuda and are designed to align with international financial, anti-money laundering, and consumer protection standards.</p>

    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>“Wallet” means a digital wallet tied to the Bermudian Dollar via the BMDX stablecoin.</li>
      <li>“NFC Device/Card” means a physical card or wearable device issued for payments.</li>
      <li>“Vendor” means a registered business or service provider accepting Payulot.</li>
      <li>“Administrator” means authorized government or system managers with compliance oversight.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Payulot may require identity verification under Bermuda’s AML/ATF laws before account activation.</li>
      <li>Payulot reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts where fraud, money laundering, or unlawful activity is suspected.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Use of Payulot</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Users agree to use Payulot lawfully and responsibly.</li>

      <li>Payulot may restrict, suspend, or terminate services for misuse, non-compliance, or regulatory reasons.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Transactions & Blockchain Auditing</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Transactions are processed off-chain for speed, with periodic cryptographic hashes recorded on the Polygon blockchain.</li>
      <li>These hashes are immutable and publicly visible, but they do not reveal individual user data.</li>
      <li>Payulot is not responsible for network delays or blockchain congestion.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>7. Vendor Obligations</h2>

          <li>Reconcile and withdraw balances in accordance with Bermuda law.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
